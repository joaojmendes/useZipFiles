# Introducing `useZipFiles`: A Powerful React Hook for Creating and Downloading ZIP Files

Managing file downloads and creating ZIP archives can be challenging, especially when dealing with APIs like SharePoint or Microsoft Graph. To simplify this process, I‚Äôve built a versatile React hook, `useZipFiles`, which allows you to fetch files or folders, compress them into a ZIP file, and trigger a download‚Äîall in one streamlined package.
